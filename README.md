# Beavers-And-Weavers

04/20/2015 - 05/15/2015

This was a project for my high school Introduction to Java Programming in which my partner and I made an educational program based on the topic of environmental science that was implemented as a resource for students in a biology class. It is evident that we were programming beginners as demonstrated by the organization (all classes in one window). This program involved event listeners,  polymorphism, inheritance, layout managers (border layouts, card layouts, and null layouts), and JComponents. This was a four week project.

This program was made myself and Matthew Crooks.

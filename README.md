# Beavers-And-Weavers

This program involved event listeners,  polymorphism, inheritance, layout managers (border layouts, card layouts, and null layouts), and JComponents. This was a four week project.

This was a project for my high school Introduction to Java Programming in which my partner and I made an educational program based on the topic of environmental science that was implemented as a resource for students in a biology class. Users must navigate the boat from one sie of the river to the other without hitting the obstacles, which are representative of pollutants. After the student succesfully crosses, the student is asked a ecology question that, when answered correctly, is followed by the next level of gameplay. 

As this was an Intro to Proramming class and we felt pressed by time, the lack of organization skills is evident primarily through the fact that all the classes are on one window.

This program was made myself and Matthew Crooks.
